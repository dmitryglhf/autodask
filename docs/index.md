## The Distributed AutoML Solution

AutoDask is a lightweight AutoML library that brings together the power of distributed computing with Dask and the intelligence of Bee Colony Optimization for hyperparameter tuning.

```commandline
pip install autodask
```

```python
from autodask.main import AutoDask

# Create an AutoDask instance
adsk = AutoDask(task='classification')

# Train the model
adsk.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = adsk.predict(X_test)
```
